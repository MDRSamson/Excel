# Excel Analysis
This is the project that I worked on in Excel during my Bootcamp training
### Task 1: First use of aggregate values
using this **<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1THlZrzMiRK-98Rsx_Cl9aGtjrTztTKmb/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102089252926255319219&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">retail sale dataset</a>**
* **Create a table:** Select data in columns A-H, go to Insert > Table, and click OK.
* **Sort by Age:** Click the drop-down arrow in the Age column, then choose Sort Largest to Smallest.
* **SUM function:** In cell P10, enter **=SUM(range)** to calculate the total commission.
* **AVERAGE function:** In cell P11, enter **=AVERAGE(range)** to calculate the average commission.

### Task 2: Use of conditional formatting and IF function
* **Apply filter and sorting for best students:** Use the filter and sorting options for each subject column to sort the students by their scores, from highest to lowest. 
* **Calculate average:** In Column E, use the formula **=AVERAGE(range)** to calculate the average score for each student. 
* **Find highest score:** In Column F, use **=MAX(range)** to find the highest score of a student. 
* **Sort by best average:** Apply filter and sort by Column E (average score), from highest to lowest, to find the best student by average. 
* **Sort by highest score:** Apply filter and sort by the column showing the highest individual score, from highest to lowest. 
* **Conditional formatting:** Use conditional formatting to highlight the highest and lowest values in Column E, using color scales or specific rules like "Top 10%" and "Bottom 10%" to visually distinguish them. 
* **IF Functions:** create an IF function that identifies students who need additional support based on the condition on the students' Average scores.
