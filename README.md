# Excel Analysis
This is the project that I worked on in Excel during my Bootcamp training
### First use of aggregate values
using this **<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1THlZrzMiRK-98Rsx_Cl9aGtjrTztTKmb/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102089252926255319219&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">Retail Sale Dataset</a>**
* **Create a table:** Select data in columns A-H, go to Insert > Table, and click OK.
* **Sort by Age:** Click the drop-down arrow in the Age column, then choose Sort Largest to Smallest.
* **SUM function:** In cell P10, enter **=SUM(range)** to calculate the total commission.
* **AVERAGE function:** In cell P11, enter **=AVERAGE(range)** to calculate the average commission.

### Use of conditional formatting and IF function
* **Apply filter and sorting for best students:** Use the filter and sorting options for each subject column to sort the students by their scores, from highest to lowest. 
* **Calculate average:** In Column E, use the formula **=AVERAGE(range)** to calculate the average score for each student. 
* **Find highest score:** In Column F, use **=MAX(range)** to find the highest score of a student. 
* **Sort by best average:** Apply filter and sort by Column E (average score), from highest to lowest, to find the best student by average. 
* **Sort by highest score:** Apply filter and sort by the column showing the highest individual score, from highest to lowest. 
* **Conditional formatting:** Use conditional formatting to highlight the highest and lowest values in Column E, using color scales or specific rules like "Top 10%" and "Bottom 10%" to visually distinguish them. 
* **IF Functions:** create an IF function that identifies students who need additional support based on the condition on the students' Average scores.\

### Using Pivot Tables
using this **<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R_JbkuPvA2ZpAcrwhaIqatJ7Cr_wT9Yq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102089252926255319219&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">Bike Sale Dataset</a>**
* **Pivot Table:** Set up Pivot Table while selecting the relevant fields e.g., Year, Age Group, Country, Order Quantity. 
* **Create Pivot Table Chart:** Use a stacked column chart to visualize the data. Identify trends, such as the youth age group having the lowest sales globally. Adjust the chart to show aggregated sales data across age groups.\

* **Switch Function:** Create a Pivot Table to summarise the data by county and product. Use the SWITCH function to categorise products based on their sales volume.
